    <h1>Paste i jela</h1>
    <h3>Tipovi testenina</h3>
    <p>Pastas are divided into two broad categories: dried (pasta secca) and fresh (pasta fresca). Most dried pasta is
        produced commercially via an extrusion process, although it can be produced at home. Fresh pasta is
        traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple machines.[3] Fresh pastas available in grocery
        stores are produced commercially by large-scale machines.</p>

    <h3>Razlicita jela sa testeninom</h3>
    <p>As a category in Italian cuisine, both fresh and dried pastas are classically used in one of three kinds of
        prepared dishes: as pasta asciutta (or pastasciutta), cooked pasta is plated and served with a complementary
        sauce or condiment; a second classification of pasta dishes is pasta in brodo, in which the pasta is part of a
        soup-type dish. A third category is pasta al forno, in which the pasta is incorporated into a dish that is
        subsequently baked in the oven.[6] <br> Pasta dishes are generally simple, but individual dishes vary in
        preparation.
        Some pasta dishes are served as a small first course or for light lunches, such as pasta salads. Other dishes
        may be portioned larger and used for dinner. Pasta sauces similarly may vary in taste, color and texture.[7]</p>
